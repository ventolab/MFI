This document is to describe how to run notebooks within this directory.

Notebooks represent sequential steps of sc/sn RNA-seq analysis using scVI as a method of batch correction and dimensionality reduction.

All notebooks beginning with "M" or "S" in here are run on jhub within my general environment accessible here: /lustre/scratch117/cellgen/team292/aa22/sharing/202202_for_MFI_handover/202202_Anna_jhub_general_environment.yml

1 notebook beginning with "scVI_" needs to be run on farm, I include here the container file that is use for that ("container_copy_gpu-normal.sh") that I usually launch from /nfs/team292/aa22/scVI_related/202111_upd_in_vivo_analysis/

The whole workflow is aimed at defining all cell state compartments (coarse and fine grain) present at the maternal-fetal interface.
Specifically for trophoblast and invading trophoblast subset of the data this process includes many steps of what I call "clean up" which is exclusion of contaminant/noisy clusters and subsequent reanalysis of the manifold until all cell states are captured and properly annotated. Eventually I was unable to tease apart giant cells (GC) in all-donors analysis here so those labels just come from donor P13-only analysis (see folder "1-1_GEX_analysis_donor_P13" in the repo).

Order of notebooks is as follows:
- M0: preprocessing
- M1: preliminary analysis to assess batch effects etc.
- M2: inferring genes high in ambient RNA signal to then exclude them in appropriate analyses
- M3: calculation of cell cycle effect in this data and labelling genes behaving like cell cycle genes if applicable; calculation of appropriate estimate of nubmer of latent variables to be used in scVI analysis later
- scVI_integration (needs to be run on farm): batch correction and dimensionality reduction to gage the manifold with all cell states
